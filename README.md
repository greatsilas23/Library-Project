# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

#myPortfolio
## Planning
myportfolio is a website designed by greatsilas23
While some claim that web apps should be bubdled wiith dependencies, it is true to claim that dependencies consume memoryy hence making the application expensive to downoads
Covererd in the document is architecture, security and maintenance phases
## Analysis
myportfolio yields a frontend to interact with 14 repositories on http://github.com/greatsilas23/myPortfolio.git 
## Design
the web app is designed to allow hyperlink and teletext items
### hyperlinks
Lyric-guesser
Agristores-Technologies
myPokerTH
Math-Club
### teletext
Courses
## Implementation
Implementing the web app to http://github.com/greatsilas23/myPortfolio.git 
```bash 
  git add .
   git commit -m "First commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin http://github.com/greatsilas23/myPortfolio.git
   git push -u origin main
```
## Maintenance
Maintenance entails version control, testing and debugging
Version control entails incorporating design improvements into the web app
Testing entails logical comparison of data reports and security loopholes
